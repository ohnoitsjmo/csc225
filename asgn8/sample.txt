COUNT LEO NIKOLAYEVICH TOLSTOY was born
August 28, 1828, at the family estate of Yasnaya
Polyana, in the province of Tula. His mother died
when he was three and his father six years later.
Placed in the care of his aunts, he passed many
of his early years at Kazan, where, in 1844,
after a preliminary training by French tutors, he
entered the university. He cared little for the
university and in 1847 withdrew because of
"ill-health and domestic circumstances." He had,
however, done a great deal of reading, of French,
English, and Russian novels, the New Testament,
Voltaire, and Hegel. The author exercising the
greatest influence upon him at this time was
Rousseau; he read his complete works and for
sometime wore about his neck a medallion of
Rousseau.
